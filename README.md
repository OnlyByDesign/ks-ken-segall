Child theme for Ken Segall website

Throughout this whole process, I was learning about how to:
1. Create and manage DIVI pages
2. How to edit the backend of how those pages appeared
3. Editing parent theme files to serve them different through the child
4. Managing PHP snippets and plugins to achieve the client direction'

Beyond this, I was learning about how to manage client relations and communication while not having all of the anwers.

A lot of research was done, and a lot of back and forth was had. Not for nothing; Ken Segall is a returning client, and will continue to be.
